# Analogue OS Menu for ES-DE

This is a tranlation of the Analogue OS menu interface (originally designed & created by [Analogue](https://www.analogue.co/os)) for ES-DE.

My work focused on tranlating the layout so that it could be buildable in the theme engine for ES-DE.  Please refer to the `Changes Made` section below for additional details. 

The original version of the UI can be found as part of the OS available on the Analogue Pocket and other devices made by [Analogue](https://www.analogue.co/)

## Changes Made

- Referenced [Analogue OS](https://www.analogue.co/os) to approximate the components that would be used build a theme compatible with ES-DE.
- Added the helpsystem from ES-DE and created a layout that tries to evoke the original helpsystem design (sadly it can't be a 1:1 translation due to differences in the theme engines)
- Added icons and badges specific to ES-DE functionality
- Created a full set of custom pixel art icons for the ES-DE helpsystem

## **Configuration Options**

The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 

### **Variants:**

- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the gamelist view.
   - `List` - The default variant. A list view that matches the same style as system view.
   - `Carousel` - An attempt to translate the list view with images that exists in Analogue OS
   - `Grid` - An attempt to translate the grid view that exists in Analogue OS

### **Color Schemes:**

- `Theme Color Scheme` - sets the color scheme that is used for the overall theme on all views.
   - `Dark` - The default color scheme. 
   - `Light` - A `light` version of the above color scheme.

### **Font Sizes:**

- `Theme Font Size` - sets the size that text will render at. This can be helpful when using the theme on small screens.
   - Supported Font Sizes:
   - `Large` - Good for small handheld screens under 4 inches in size.

### **Aspect Ratios:**

- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio to match your display. This should happen automatically but can also be set manually if needed.
   - Supported Aspect Ratios:
   - `4:3`
   - `16:9`
   - `16:10`
   - `3:2`
   - `19.5:9`
